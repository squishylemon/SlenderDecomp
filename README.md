# SlenderOpenSource

This project aims to port the original Slender: Eight Pages game to a new Unity version, starting with Unity 5.0.0f4, which is the first version I could get running without major UI changes. The current state of the project is very primitive, not playable, and is open source for anyone to mess around with. The goal of this project is to eventually have the Slender: Eight Pages game running on Unity 2022 and support modding with multiple builds that change the game in various ways, including graphics, new maps, etc.
