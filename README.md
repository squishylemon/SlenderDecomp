## Project Overview

This project aims to port the original *Slender: Eight Pages* game to a new Unity version, starting with **Unity 5.0.0f4**. This is the first version that I could get running without major UI changes. 

### Current Status:
- The project is currently nearly finised for **Unity 5.0.0f4**, All thats needed is to fix minor differences from offical such as brightness,lighting,material reflections etc
- It is open source, allowing anyone to explore and experiment with it.

### Future Goals:
- Upgrade to **Unity 2022**.
- Support modding with multiple builds to modify the game in various ways, including graphics, new maps, and more.

### Game Description:
*Slender* is a short, experimental horror game where you must venture into dark woods at night with a simple goal: find 8 pages scattered throughout the woods. As you search, you are stalked by an entity that becomes more persistent and relentless with each collected page. This entity cannot be looked at for long and cannot be fought. Your only hope is to collect all 8 pages before the entity catches you...

### Current Stable Unity Version:
- **Unity 5.0.0f4**
