## Project Overview

This project aims to port the original *Slender: The Eight Pages* game to newer Unity versions, starting with **Unity 5.0.0f4**.

### Current Status
- The project includes working source code for two Unity versions:
  - **Unity 5.0.0f4**: The most stable and "official" decompilation, as it runs on a Unity version closest to the one used in the original game's development.
  - **Unity 2022.3.46f1**: Recently added and nearing completion, but may contain visual bugs or incomplete features due to the newer engine's differences.

- **Future Plans**: Once the Unity 2022 version is stable, the groundwork will be laid for *Slender: The Eight Pages Ultimate Edition*. This new edition will include new features and broader compatibility. However, this repository will remain an unchanged, faithful decompilation of the original game.

- The project is open source, encouraging exploration and experimentation.

### Future Goals
- Finalize the **Unity 2022** version.
- Introduce modding support with multiple builds, enabling players to modify:
  - Graphics
  - New maps
  - Additional features

### Game Description
*Slender: The Eight Pages* is a short, experimental horror game. Players navigate dark woods at night with a simple goal: collect 8 pages scattered throughout the area. As you search, you are stalked by an entity that grows more persistent and relentless with each page you collect. This entity cannot be fought and must not be looked at for long. Your only chance of survival is to gather all 8 pages before it catches you...

### Supported Unity Versions
- **Unity 5.0.0f4** (stable)
- **Unity 2022.3.46f1** (in progress)
